The problem of creating a secure way to login is actually extremely difficult, but I think I figured it out.

Client                    Server                    Database
AUTH_USER
  username=
  password=
                          Recieve AUTH request
                          Validate the user
                          Create session ID
                                                    Store session ID
                          Send ID to client
Store ID to cookies
Switch to main page
Load cookies
LOAD_USER
  session=
                          Validate the session ID
                                                    Delete the session ID
                                                    Get the user's data
                          Give user their data
Load session
Finished!
