The problem of creating a secure way to login is actually extremely difficult, but I think I figured it out.

Client                    Server                    Database
AUTH_USER
  username=
  password=
                          Recieve AUTH request
                          Validate the user
                          Create session
                                                    Store session ID
                          Send ID to client
Store ID to cookies
Switch to main page
Load cookies
LOAD_USER
  session=
                          Query the database
                                                    Get the user's data
                          Give user their data
Load session
Finished!

If you can see any major flaws in the security of this system please contact me, I'd love to hear them.
