These are things that need to be recreated differently

Data query system
  - Reworking Process
    Locate all of the points in which data is sent and recieved
    Decide what data is being sent and recieved for each query
    Go through each one and recreate it using headers
    
  - Security
    the current system that's set in place it terrible here
    the content of a user's query can be seen in plain text
    from just the URL alone
  
    - Fix
      See if there is a way to tap into Heroku's https through the DNS
