This log is for the development of a structure to store data in on the database.



HASH passwords
  username: password hash

HASH cash
  username: ammount

HASH influences
  username: {influence_type: ammount, ...}

Notes:
There is no need to store CPS, because it will just get overwritten with zero before initalizing the influences.
Use a hidden value in each item hash to ensure the user is not allowed to access items that are still in development
(Possibly add an overide for this with a propper dev key, maybe not, who knows. It would just make testing easy)
